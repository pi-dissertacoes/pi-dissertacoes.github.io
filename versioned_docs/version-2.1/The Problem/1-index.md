# Context and State of The Art (SOA)

In the context of dissertation and internships choice, nowadays Aveiro University (UA) has different ways to deal with this problematic. In the Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics (DETI), this choice is being supported by a platform developed by a group of DETI students in the 2000s, which is available at http://sd.web.ua.pt.

Over the years, no additional features have been developed and maintenance has been minimal, which lead to a platform that has a outdated UI, untapped bugs, growing security vulnerabilities and technologies that are less used, such as aspx in old versions of ASP.NET, that is a server-side web-application framework designed for web development to produce dynamic web pages.

With this concepts in mind, the objective of this project is to overhaul the existent platform to manage amongst other things the publicity and bidding process of dissertations in the MSc taught by DETI.

The new platform should provide a renewed interface and functionalities to assist both teachers and students in advertising and choosing their final dissertation projects.
