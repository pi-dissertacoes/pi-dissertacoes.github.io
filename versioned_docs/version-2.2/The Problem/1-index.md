# Context and State of The Art (SOA)

Our project focuses on the continued development of an application designed for MSc students at the university to select topics for their dissertation, projects and internships. Supervising professors will also use the platform to manage and assign these projects.

The platform, available at dissertacoes.av.it.pt, was created to replace an older system but remains unfinished. Several functionalities have yet to be implemented, and the system currently has bugs and other issues. Additionally, the user interface could be improved, and the submission process streamlined to reduce bureaucracy. Another key enhancement would be the automatic generation of meeting minutes.
